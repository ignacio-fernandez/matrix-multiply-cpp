# Matrix and Vector Math with C++

## The Data
The file dataVector is an array of 16 numbers, which is used as an input by both
data_main.cpp and data_bonus.cpp.

## Vector Math

To compile the program, compile the main data_main.cpp file along with vector_functions.cpp

It will input dataVector and create 4 vectors, each of length 4. It will output The sum of the vectorrs,
the length of each vector, and the dot product and angle of each vector pair to the file vectorMath.

## Matrix Math

To compile this program, compile the main data_bonus.cpp file along with matrix_functions.cpp and vector_functions.cpp.

It will take the same dataVector file as input and create a 4x4 matrix. For performance reasons, the matrix will be
represented as a 1D array.

The program will output to matrixMath the matrix, its transpose, and the product of the matrix by itself.
